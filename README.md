# 3BodySim

## Simple simulation using pygame and Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

### Dependencies

`pip install pygame`

### Usage

Launch `python display.py` to display the objects in the simulation.

### Commands

While running the simulation, you can press:

* c - Next Color (8 bit colors)
* C - Previous Color
* \-  - Decrement radius by 5px
* \+ - Increment radius by 5px
* d - Increment density by 50 mass/pixel
* D - Decrement density by 50 mass/pixel
* v - Increment velocity in both axis by 10px/tick (1 tick = 0.1 seconds)
* V - Decrement velocity in both axis by 10px/tick
* x - Increment velocity in horizontal axis by 10px/tick
* X - Decrement velocity in horizontal axis by 10px/tick
* y - Increment velocity in vertical axis by 10px/tick
* Y - Decrement velocity in vertical axis by 10px/tick
